(if ur a sec 1 who wanna know how to install vpn to ur pc its gonna come out later lol, idk when ill do it but ill do it eventually)

I do NOT encourage or condure the utilisation of the vpn during class or school time C: dont use it

btw install the app "1.1.1.1" or "Cloudflare one agent" both works fine

1: Create an cloudflare account via https://dash.cloudflare.com/sign-up (NOTE: DO NOT use your school email. Use an personal email ex: @gmail.com, @outlook...)

2: Go to zero trust section after making your account (https://ibb.co/hKG3sWC)

3:Go to Firewall Policies and add a policy (https://ibb.co/ZN4FHCW)

4:Name your policy and add the following things: Domain, is, mosyle.com (https://ibb.co/DfK7sD5)

5: On action select "block"

6: Go to access groupe and add a groupe

7: add "emails ends in" and enters the domain of the email you are using (ex: @gmail.com, @outlook.com...)

8: Save your work and go to connect first device

9: Follow the guide and connect your device

9: To have your games during schoo time, enable the vpn before your apps are blocked in order to have them up for the school day.
