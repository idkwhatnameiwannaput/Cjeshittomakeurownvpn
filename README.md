2: Go to zero trust section after making your account

3:Go to Firewall Policies and add a policy

4:Name your policy and add the following things: Domain, is, mosyle.com

5: On action select "block"

6: Save your work and go to connect first device

8: To have your games during schoo time, enable the vpn before your apps are blocked in order to have them up for the school day.
